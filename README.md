# GoMLP
A proof of concept library written as a small part of the paper ["An exploration of FPGA based Multilayer Perceptron using Residue Number System for Space Applications"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8652487).  
The library allows the user to run a fully functional Multilayer Perceptron and is written in GoLang.
